What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
Array:
  1. contains elements as a set of ordered list
  2. they are separated by a comma
  3. they are good for last in first out stack evaluation processes
  4. They can be retrieved by their index (they start from 0 onwards)
  5. They can have nested arrays as individual elements within an array

Hashes:
  1. Hashes exists in a state of key, value pairs.
  2. the keys can be a symbol, integer, float or a string
  3. the values can be any datatype within the boundaries provided by Ruby
  4. the value can also be an array
  5. key can be retreived through the value and vice versa.
