# ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
#   from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
#   from (irb):4
#   from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'


# Answer
# this implies that while calling the method wrong number of arguments are assigned to the method calculate_product ie here 1 argument is passed to the calculate_product method instead of 2.
